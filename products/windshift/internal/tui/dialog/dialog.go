// Package dialog defines a small overlay-dialog interface used by the TUI.
//
// Each open dialog is one entry on Model.dialogs []Dialog. The top of the
// stack receives key events; everything paints from bottom up so the most
// recent dialog appears on top. A dialog signals dismissal (and optional
// follow-up Cmd / selection) via Action.
