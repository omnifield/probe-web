# Layering guard: enforces architectural import rules that go beyond what
# golangci-lint catches.
#
# Each rule is `<package_glob>::<forbidden_import_path>::<rationale>`.
# A rule fires when any non-test .go file in the package matches the glob and
# imports the forbidden path. Failures print file:line and the rationale.
#
# Existing violations are documented in .layering-baseline so we can land this
# guard without a giant migration. Anything outside the baseline fails the
# build. To remove an entry from the baseline, fix the violation; to add one,
# explain in the commit why.
#
# Bypass: set LAYERING_SKIP=1 (e.g. for emergency commits).
