## One place for the work that matters

Windshift brings planning, tracking, and collaboration into a fast, flexible workspace. Start with a simple kanban board, then add the structure your team needs: custom workflows, nested work items, milestones, saved searches, dashboards, and more.

It ships as a single Go binary with the Svelte frontend built in. 

## Highlights

- Plan work your way - move between boards, backlogs, hierarchy views, milestones, iterations, and dashboards as your work evolves.
- Customize the workflow around your team - configure item types, statuses, fields, screens, priorities, and recurring work.
- Keep context - add rich descriptions, comments, mentions, attachments, collections, and knowledge pages.
- Bring customers into the system - share public boards and accept external requests through a customer portal.
- Connect the tools you already use - integrate GitHub, Gitea, and Forgejo, import Jira projects, and send email or webhook notifications.
- Add the capabilities you need - extend work management with test management, time tracking, or asset management.
